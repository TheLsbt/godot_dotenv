# What is Godot dotenv

A godot plugin to help load enviroment variables using one line.
```gdscript
Dotenv.load('path/to/env/file')
```

# Complements?
These are scripts that allow dotenv to interact with the editor doing things such as syntax highlighting or showing you errors (comming soon) in your **.env** file. If you dont want any a particular feature you can entirely remove the file or disable it from your project settings
